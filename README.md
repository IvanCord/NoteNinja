# NoteNinja
Capture, convert, conquer the class.

NoteNinja is an AI-powered app designed to help students capture insightful lecture notes directly from photos taken in class. Snap a picture of your lecture slides or notes, and let NoteNinja convert it into clean, organized notes powered by advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP). This open-source project is aimed at making your study process faster, more efficient, and smarter!
